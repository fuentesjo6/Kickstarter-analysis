We can see from the chart below that Kickstarter campaign success begins to fall as you ask for more money. From less than $1,000 up to about $20,000 their is a 50% chance or better to acheive your goal but after that you are more likely to fail. Althouhg towards the back the higher amounts there seems to be success we do not have enough data to make a decision as there are not enouhg campaigns.
